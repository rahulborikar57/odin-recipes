                <li>1 small fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced, fronds reserved</li>
                <li>juice and zest 1 lemon</li>
                <li>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
                <li>1 tsp clear honey</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>4 trout fillets, skin on</li>
                <li>100g soured cream</li>
                <li>1/2 small pack dill, leaves finely chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 small pack flat-leaf parsley, leaves finely chopped</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the potatoes
                    in a pan of boiling salted water and simmer for 
                    15 mins until cooked, then drain. Put the onion 
                    and fennel in a bowl, cover with the lemon juice 
                    and set aside. Mix half the lemon zest with the 
                    mustard, honey and oil. Place the trout, skin-side 
                    down, on a baking tray lined with parchment. Brush 
                    the mustard glaze over the trout and bake in the 
                    oven for 10 mins until just cooked and starting to 
                    flake.
                </p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice 
                    them into 1 cm-thick pieces and tip into a large 
                    bowl. Mix the remaining lemon zest with the soured 
                    cream, dill, parsley and some seasoning. Spoon over 
                    the potatoes and stir through. Add the onion and 
                    fennel, and mix gently. Sprinkle the reserved fennel
                     fronds over and serve with the trout.
