        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp honey</li>
            <li>2 salmon fillets</li>
            <li>250g pouch ready-cooked puy lentils</li>
            <li>250g pack ready-cooked beetroot, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>2 tbsp crème fraîche</li>
            <li>1 small pack dill, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp capers</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, zested and cut into 2 wedges to serve</li>
            <li>2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted</li>
            <li>rocket, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix together 1 tbsp oil, 
            the mustard, honey and some seasoning. Put the salmon 
            fillets on a baking tray and spread the honey and mustard 
            mixture all over. Tip the lentils and beetroot into a 
            casserole dish, toss with the remaining oil and season well. 
            Put both in the oven for 10 mins until the salmon is 
            cooked through.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Stir the crème fraîche, dill, capers and lemon zest through the 
            lentils. Serve alongside the salmon with the pumpkin seeds 
            scattered over and lemon wedges for squeezing, with a rocket 
            salad on the side, if you like.
        </p>
